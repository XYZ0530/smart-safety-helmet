# Smart Safety Helmet 🦺🤖
This project was developed as part of the course Technology and Application of IoT (SWE403) at Xiamen University Malaysia.

## 📌 Overview

The **Smart Safety Helmet** is an **IoT-based wearable safety device** designed to enhance worker protection on construction sites. Powered by an **ESP32 microcontroller**, the helmet integrates **environmental and motion sensors** to detect hazards such as smoke, excessive heat, and falls, while providing **real-time alerts** via LED, buzzer, vibration, and cloud connectivity.

This project was developed as part of the course *Technology and Application of IoT* at Xiamen University Malaysia, and aligns closely with **Automation Development Engineering** practices by combining **embedded systems, robotics-inspired safety feedback, and industrial IoT communication**.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Multi-sensor hazard detection**

  * MQ-2 smoke sensor (fire/gas hazards)
  * DHT11 temperature & humidity sensor (heat stress monitoring)
  * MPU-6050 accelerometer (fall/impact detection)
  * LDR (auto headlamp activation in low-light)

* **Real-time alerts**

  * RGB LED (status indication)
  * Piezo buzzer (audible warning)
  * Vibration motor (haptic feedback in noisy environments)

* **Automatic headlamp** for improved visibility in dark environments.

* **Cloud connectivity via MQTT** for remote supervision and faster emergency response.

* **Event-driven, non-blocking firmware** ensuring hazard detection under **400 ms** without blocking delays.

* **Security-first design** with **TLS 1.3 encrypted communication** and secure firmware updates.

## 🛠️ System Workflow

1. **Continuous monitoring** of temperature, smoke, light levels, and motion.
2. **Local alerts** via LED, buzzer, and vibration when a hazard is detected.
3. **Cloud notification** through MQTT, enabling supervisors to monitor workers in real time.
4. **User acknowledgement** with a long-press reset button to clear active alerts.
5. **Fail-safe recovery** ensures the helmet resumes safe monitoring after hazards are cleared.

## 🖥️ Software Architecture

* **Event-driven firmware** written in Arduino (C++), deployed on ESP32.
* **Non-blocking design** using `millis()` for sensor polling and timing (no `delay()`), ensuring responsiveness.
* **Five subsystems running in parallel**:

  * Initialization & setup
  * Connectivity management (Wi-Fi + MQTT)
  * Sensor monitoring (light, smoke, temperature, motion)
  * Alert presentation (multimodal warnings)
  * Idle & recovery (return to safe standby)

---

## 📊 Performance

* Hazard detection within **\~400 ms**.
* Stable for a **full 8-hour work shift** on a rechargeable power bank.
* Cloud alerts published instantly via MQTT.
* Secure communication (TLS 1.3, WPA2-Enterprise Wi-Fi).

Do you also want me to make a **small ASCII block diagram** of the system workflow (sensors → ESP32 → alerts/cloud) that you can add under the workflow section?
